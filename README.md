### About me
I'm a university student studying IT while also working as a hardware- and fullstack-software developer. I'm the author of Inkycal and have several years of hands-on experience working at several different IT-startups, making my skillset pretty diverse, ranging from CAD, 3d-printing, pcb-design with focus on energy efficiency and ultra-low deepsleep, developing specialised algorithms for e-paper displays, designing entire webservers (front+endback), PWAs, REST-APIs and embedded systems with high-security currently used in production environments. I'm also well familiar with the Raspberry Pi, Arduino and ESP32 (ArduinoIDE, PlatformIO and ESP-IDF) and have worked intensively with e-paper displays for several years. I also run a shop on tindie and occasionally blog about my hobby-projects. In my free time, I like to develop Inkycal, however, my main occupation is being CTO at a startup based in Germany.
